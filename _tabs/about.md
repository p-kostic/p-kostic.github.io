I'm a BSc Computer Science graduate that's currently completing the Software Engineering master's programme at the University of Amsterdam. I also work as a full time .NET Software Engineer. 

My interests include .NET, Microsoft Azure, data science, CTFs, visualisations, Haskell, and video games. More about me personally can be found on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pekostic).

This blog will serve as my personal knowledge base in a sharable format. The topics I write about can vary greatly, but most of them will remain in the technology domain (i.e. software & hardware).

Previously, most of the things I have written down were mostly scattered around [Notable.md](https://notable.app/), [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/), or [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) on my Synology NAS . Having this blog as my only (public) publishing format forces me to be clear and concise while remaining thorough and detailed about the information I am trying to provide.
